###Coverletter readme: 

What you need:
To make the coverletter autofill sheet you need 3 things: 
1. Completed coverletter template filled out with your own info with the correct codes incorporated so the sheet can read it and automate it. Note: In the end you should have two types of coverletters: one for companies whom you do not know the receiver, and one for companies who you do know the receiver (i.e. a specific name for a recruiter). The link is here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Hjl7lmeHdFFgkfjslJGPDUpka-wbGFI04XVNtqezSo/edit
2. A created folder for the coverletters to be placed in (COVERLETTER MASTER sheet also needs to be in this folder, the document created and filled out in #1). Note: the auto-generated coverletters using the code below will also be in this folder for easy organization/deleting after you're done. 
3. Cover letter template form: the sheet that you put in the companyname/company position and the link it will generate in the column, it should look like this: https://i.imgur.com/NX6Avml.jpg
4. Links to two things: The Coverletter MASTER link in google drive, and the folder (to place the created Coverletter templates). 

Follow the steps below:
Step 1: Use the template provided at the link here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Hjl7lmeHdFFgkfjslJGPDUpka-wbGFI04XVNtqezSo/edit
Step 2: Read the first page and customize it to your liking with keywords associated with your industry, as stated above, you should have two types but you can just use the generic one first and just remember to change the intro if you do know the recruiter's name. Red is the places where you need to fill it out. If you still have red in the doc then you missed something. I would label this doc as COVERLETTER MASTER.
Step 3: Make the Cover letter template sheet according to this photo: https://i.imgur.com/NX6Avml.jpg
Should have 5 columns and it should be in that exact order: firstName, lastName, title, companyname, companyposition, Document Link as show in the link. I'm going to label this sheet as 'Coverletter template'
Step 4: Make a new folder in google docs, place the COVERLETTER MASTER in this folder (the auto-generated coverletters will also be in this folder for easy organization/deletion). I'm just going to label this folder as 'Coverletters'
Step 5: Copy the code below the row of ### number signs
Step 6: Save the code, refresh the page and try it out! 


tl;dr - Get the link to make the template above, get the url, put it in the code below, make a google doc folder, get the url and put it below too, make a google excel sheet as indicated in the imgur link above, copy the code below the ### hasthtags in with the correct urls for both folder and template above and voila autogenerate your template. If its breaks go below to find how it broke.

Additional info:

Points of fuckery: 
 - If there is an error check the url within the code of your 'Coverletter template' sheet it might be either the COVERLETTER MASTER url or the COVERLETTER folder url. Make sure to include the '' quote/apostrophe marks encompassing the url, (these are not "" quotation marks)
 - only copy the code after the bar of ########## below.
 - There's also notes about the code too above each individual line, but you don't have to worry about it unless you're tweaking it for something else. Just make sure to edit the codes following the 3 ### number signs while including the apostrophes/single quote marks/foot&inches indicator '.
 - CHANGE google sheet to 'DATA' instead of the default 'Sheet1'
 - SAVE column 5 for DocumentLink
 - The commands: {{Sample}} are case sensitive.
 - folder syntax is fucking weird af too, it might be in a different format than what I have in mine - to debug just create another folder and notice the prefix/suffix codes for the created folders.

Points about the URL:
### From 'COVERLETTER MASTER' get Google doc code from the URL above. For example: using the template the url is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Hjl7lmeHdFFgkfjslJGPDUpka-wbGFI04XVNtqezSo/edit so the code is: 17Hjl7lmeHdFFgkfjslJGPDUpka-wbGFI04XVNtqezSo, after the document/d/xxx and before the '/edit' ending. The two URLs you'll need are: one for the COVERLETTER MASTER doc, and the other for the folder you created and put the COVERLETTER MASTER doc in. It will also create the templates in that folder as well (You can delete the other templates in which it should be named: 'firstname_lastname_Coverletter'. The folder you create will also have a url similar to the document url above and should look similar to this: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXGl?ths=true
 - Use the code following the /folders/xxx and cut it off before the '=true' ending.


If following the step by step above this is step 5: Copy the code below into the google sheet 'cover template form' (the one that you write the companyname/companyposition in): Extensions => Apps Script, fill the code parts in where indicated WITH the ['' quotes with the correct urls], save when done and refresh the excel sheet, a new button should appear called 'AutoFill Coverletter', so when you put in the info it will create the doc with the link in the 'Document link column' where you can customize it even more if you want with certain keywords in the job description if you already don't have it.

Parts of the sheet to change:
 1. First row needs to be changed in according to the body.replaceText{{xx}} parts (CASE SENSITIVE)
 2. The default sheet name of 'Sheet1' needs to be changed to 'Data'



Parts of the codes to change:

### Google Drive Folder Link:
  
  const destinationFolder = DriveApp.getFolderById('###Make a folder in google docs and get the folder link xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx###')

### Google Doc Coverletter TEMPLATE MASTER
  
  const googleDocTemplate = DriveApp.getFileById('###googledoc code from the link###');

### Title of the file that you will create: rows 0 & 1 and anything within the apostrophes

  const copy = googleDocTemplate.makeCopy(`${row[0]}_${row[1]}_Coverletter`, destinationFolder)

### Replacing the texts, you can add more but skip row 5 since that will be the 'DocumentLink' row that is auto-generated from executing the script - Just remember that the first row is Row 0 in computerspeak so it goes Row 0, Row 1, Row 2, etc.
 - Note it is also case sensitive so if something is not changing and is without errors then it is probably a case sensitive error.

    body.replaceText('{{First Name}}', row[0]);
    body.replaceText('{{Last Name}}', row[1]);
    body.replaceText('{{companyname}}', row[3]);
    body.replaceText('{{companyposition}}', row[4]);
